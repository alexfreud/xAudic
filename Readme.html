<p>xAudic was first released on May 31, 1999 for MacOS X
Server under the name MacOSXAmp. And, until now, hadn't been updated since July 9, 1999. I
finally got around to updating it for MacOS X Client, which took
a good bit of work. This version does not perform very well on my
266Mhz G3, but should perform well on more recent Macs. I see
15%-20% CPU utilization on my machine. I'm interested to here how
it works for others. If your worried about skipping and SPU
utilization, make sure keep visualizations off. Visualizations
increas CPU utilization three fold. </p>

<p>Please let me know what you need/hate/love about the app, and
if your a developer please help me improve it. </p>

<p>The latest version of xAudic includes support for user
created User Interfaces. It is now very simple to create a new
interface for the application. If you can use InterfaceBuilder,
you can create a UI. No coding is needed, although you can also
create a .bundle with your code for the interface in it. See the
UserInterfaces/Sample for an example of a coded UI, and
UICreation.html and xAudic.app/Contents/Resources/UIPlugins/*
for nib only examples. If you create a new UI, please send it to
me. I'll post on the web site.</p>

    <p>You can use almost any skin made for WinAmp or x11amp with
    MaxOSXAmp.Just place the skin zip, tar, tgz, or directory in
    one of the following directories:</p>

<p><strong>Plugin Developement:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Plugins are bundles which are found in the standard
    Library search path under xAudic/Plugins. The bundle
    should include a class or classes which are derived from one
    of the plugin classes: Input, Output, Effect, or General.
    You'll have to link against the MXA.framework that's in the
    application wrapper. Most of it's pretty strait forward, but
    have a look at the included plugins to get more info. </p>
